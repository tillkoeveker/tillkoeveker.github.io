Welcome!

I am a research associate in the Climate Policy Department at [DIW Berlin](https://www.diw.de/en/) and a PhD candidate in Economics at [TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/en/) and the [DIW Graduate Center](https://https://www.diw.de/de/diw_01.c.619412.de/graduate_center.html).

My research centers on Environmental Economics and Climate Policy with a focus on industrial decarbonization and the heat transition in the residential sector.

I will be joining the [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/) and [Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment](https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/) as a visiting research student from January to April 2026.

Please get in touch if you would like to chat ab research or policy questions!
