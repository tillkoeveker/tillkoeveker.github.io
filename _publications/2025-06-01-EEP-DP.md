excerpt: "This paper revisits the exporter’s environmental premium (EEP) by incorporating emissions embodied in domestically and internationally sourced intermediate inputs. Combining administrative firm-level data and customs records for German manufacturers with an environmentally extended input-output table and fuel specific emission factors, we document three stylized facts: (i) embodied emissions account for over half of firms’ total emissions; (ii) exporters’ production involves disproportionately more embodied emissions, particularly through international sourcing; and (iii) once embodied emissions are considered, the EEP reverses: exporters appear cleaner based on production-related emissions alone, but dirtier in total emissions. We rationalize these patterns in a sourcing model and test its predictions using a shift-share IV strategy based on foreign demand shocks. Export expansion lowers the production-related emission intensity without affecting total emissions, underscoring the role of sourcing in shaping firm-level environmental outcomes. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for embodied emissions when evaluating the welfare and environmental consequences of trade liberalization."
